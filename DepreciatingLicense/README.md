# Depreciating License
Also known as Harberger Tax, a depreciating license model offers an alternative asset ownership system. Under this scheme, each asset's value is continuously self-assessed by the owner. During each epoch, the owner will pay a tax based on the self-assessed value. At any epoch, another entity may purchase the asset for the self-assessed value causing ownership to change. The taxes may be used to fund the platform (ICO-alternative) or given back to all platform users.

Also known as:
- Harberger Tax
- Common-ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST)

## Strategies
If the value of the asset is assessed too high, the owner will have more security but pay more in taxes. If the value is too low, the owner will pay less in taxes but the asset will be less secure. This encourages the asset owner to set a price relative to the value that the owner receives from the asset. To offset the tax, the owner must efficiently utilize the asset by either increasing the asset's value or derive profit by leveraging the asset.

## Goals
The goal of the depreciating license model is to improve the efficiency and liquidity of assets within a market. This model treats scarce assets as a common resource, where the current owner can rent the asset from the commons for a continous fee in exchange for the privilege to leverage the asset. The continuous tax provides price discovery for markets which may have traditionally suffered from lack of liquidity and prevents stagnation associated with monopolies.
