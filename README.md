# RxC_SDK
A set of reference libraries for implementing RadicalMarket concepts.  These libraries serve as a shared knowledge base for aggregating real-world feedback on how these mechanisms function in practice.  Each of these libraries will be configurable to express a wide range of implementation options. This library will start with a set of generic smart contracts that follow common Ethereum standards and grow to cover UI implementations. 

Our goal is for this repository to serve as a Schelling point for:
- Technical guide for RxC mechanisms and best practices
- A cross-road for RxC researchers and application developers
- User experience studies
- Directory of applications using these mechanisms

## Contracts
- Quadratic Voting
  - ERC20 implementation
- Depreciating License
  - ERC721 Implementation
- Identity Sets
  - Can be used for issuing votes or taxes
 - Compatible with ERC725
- Auctions
- Prediction Markets

## Roadmap
1. Work with RxC implementations to understand SDK coverage needs
2. Generic smart contract implementation
3. Configurable UI
